1. Project Overview
Daedalus Howell & Co. requires an automated platform that transforms long-form audio (e.g., podcast or radio show episodes) into YouTube-ready video content. Instead of static cover art, each upload should generate bespoke, ambient “visual wallpaper”—subtle, slow-moving imagery that’s optionally responsive to audio. This keeps viewer attention while respecting the primary focus: the audio. Brand assets—logo intro, title card, lower-thirds, and end-screen—should be overlaid automatically.

2. Core Objectives

Automate video creation from audio uploads

Enhance viewer retention with evolving, low-distraction visuals

Embed brand identity through consistent overlays

Generate unique visual IP for each episode

3. Functional Requirements

Input:

Accept WAV/MP3 files (≤ 250 MB)

Optional episode metadata (title, guest, summary)

Optional branding assets (logo, sponsor bug)

Processing:

Generate visuals from a style preset using AI

Render 1080p MP4 @ 30fps

Light audio-reactivity: pulse, color shift, drift

Overlay/Branding:

5-second animated logo intro

Lower-thirds every ~10 minutes

Title card at start

End screen with CTA and sponsor slot

Style Selection:

Library of 3+ style presets

Choose preset per episode

Output:

Final MP4

Matching thumbnail JPG (e.g., from 00:05 timestamp)

Optional: caption support, YouTube integration

4. User Workflow

Upload audio file and optional metadata

Select style preset

Preview short video clip (15 sec sample)

Approve or regenerate

Render full video

Download or publish to YouTube

5. Initial Style Presets

1. French New Wave

Black & white jump cuts, freeze frames, grainy film look

Muted colors or high-contrast B/W

Zooms and cuts synced with vocal energy

2. ’80s Retro Chromatic

Neon gridlines, VHS textures, synthwave aesthetic

Magenta/cyan palettes

Audio triggers slight jitter or VHS flicker

3. Wine-Country Dreamscape

Abstract vineyards, painterly textures, soft camera drifts

Warm terracotta and gold

Gentle transitions and bloom on vocal peaks

6. Branding Elements

Logo intro (MOV, 1080p, alpha channel)

Lower-third ID template (semi-transparent bar, Source Sans Pro)

Title card with episode name

End-screen with CTA and sponsor placement

All overlays should respect YouTube-safe UI margins (≥90px)

7. Technical Notes

Use latent diffusion video model with audio-reactive conditioning

Render pipeline includes:

Audio analysis (RMS, silence, frequency)

Keyframe generation

Interpolation for 30fps

FFmpeg overlay pass

Final file size should be <1 GB/hour

8. Deliverables

MVP platform (web app or desktop tool)

3 launch-ready visual style presets

Overlay template kit

Render log per video (seed, params)

Documentation (API, setup, style formats)

9. Success Metrics

+25% watch time vs. static-image baseline

≥95% successful renders

<10 minutes total user input time per episode

Viewer like:dislike ratio ≥ 4:1 on visual presentation

10. Timeline (Indicative)

Week 1: Spec & architecture

Week 2–4: Prototype (30-sec sample from audio)

Week 5–6: Build presets and overlay automation

Week 7–8: Beta test with 5 episodes

Week 9: Launch polish & go live

11. Creative Guardrails

Visuals must support the audio, not distract

No strobe or high-frequency motion

Optional humorous text cards allowed

Must comply with YouTube’s monetization-friendly visual standards

12. Open Engineering Questions

Preferred model base (e.g., Stable Video Diffusion, Runway, Pika)?

Cloud GPU rendering or in-house resources?

Is multi-language text support needed in the first release?
